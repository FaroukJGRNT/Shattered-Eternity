# Shattered-Eternity
A roguelike game developed on Godot.

Shattered Eternity (the game that did not want to be played) first presents itself as a classic pixel-art metroidvania: the player, summoned into an unknown world, must prevent the prophecy of an omnipotent being destined to destroy the universe. Each run lasts 30 minutes, during which the player must explore and prepare for the final battle, before being teleported into the arena. Only one path truly allows the player to become powerful enough to defeat the boss, pushing them to replay multiple times.

But with each attempt, the world gradually deteriorates and characters seem to relive certain scenes, until the player discovers that they themselves are the monster of the prophecy, responsible for the time loops that corrupt the village, driven only by the desire for victory. The boss, in reality a character aware of the danger posed by the player, tries to stop them, but the playerâ€™s curiosity keeps pushing them forward even after learning the truth.

The game can only end in two ways: either by giving up on playing, or by reaching the final loop, where the boss, having gained meta-control, permanently prevents any further restart.
